<h1>Keran Leukeu</h1>
<p>I was born and raised in Maryland and have played basketball for the majority of my life up until now</p>
<p>I'm trying to build as many technical skills as possible during college. <strong> I know a decent amount of front-end dev </strong> and <strong>little bit of c ++ </strong></p>
<p>In 10 years, I want to be either a <em>Developer or a Product Manager.</em></p>
