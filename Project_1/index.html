    <h1>Keran Leukeu</h1>
    <p>I was born and raised in Maryland and have played basketball for the majority of my life up until now</p>
    <p>I'm trying to build as many technical skills as possible during college. <strong>I know a decent amount of front-end dev</strong> and <strong>little bit of c ++</strong></p>
    <p>In 10 years, I want to be either a <em>Developer or a Product Manager.</em></p>
